## **🌟 Top Story: The Rise of Agentic AI Foundations**

The industry has reached a turning point in AI orchestration. The **Linux Foundation** has officially announced the formation of the **Agentic AI Foundation**, a move designed to standardize the way autonomous agents interact, reason, and execute tasks.

In parallel, the ecosystem is rapidly maturing with tools like [**Goose**](https://github.com/block/goose)—an open-source AI agent that enhances developer productivity—and [**Unblink**](https://github.com/zapdos-labs/unblink), signaling a shift from simple "Chatbots" to proactive "Agents" that live within our IDEs and data stacks.


## **❄️ Snowflake Spotlight: Engineering the Modern Data Fabric**

### **High-Performance Streaming & Iceberg**

Snowflake's architecture is evolving to prioritize open standards and real-time ingestion.

* **Snowpipe Streaming to Iceberg:** New architectural guides highlight how to achieve high-performance streaming directly into Iceberg tables, combining the agility of streaming with the portability of open formats.  
* **Dynamic Tables 2026 Guide:** Master zero-copy backfills and dual virtual warehouse strategies to optimize your transformation pipelines.  
* **CDC Simplified:** A new developer guide walks through building streaming data pipelines using CDC, Snowpipe Streaming, and Dynamic Tables.

### **The Agentic Intelligence Layer**

Snowflake is no longer just a data warehouse; it is an agentic platform.

* **Cortex Agent Evaluations:** With the new **GPA Framework**, teams can now quantitatively measure the performance of AI agents.  
* **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Learn to build complex systems using **Snowflake Intelligence** to orchestrate multiple agents for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and FSI applications.  
* **Managed MCP for Cortex:** Developers can now leverage the OpenAI SDK alongside Managed Model Context Protocol (MCP) to give Cortex agents even more context.
