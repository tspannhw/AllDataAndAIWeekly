**SNACK-AI integrates:**

* **S**nowflake Platform  
* **N**iFi (Apache)  
* **A**pache Iceberg (Apache Iceberg)  
* **C**ortex AI (Agents/Search/MCP)  
* **K**afka (Apache Kafka)

### **Deep Dive into SNACK-AI:**

* **Read:** [SNACK-AI: The 2026 Pattern (Medium)](https://medium.com/@tspann/snack-ai-d8c5dd692929)  
* **Code:** [Official SNACK-AI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tspannhw/SNACK-AI)
